# Udacity Memory Game Project

HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript matching memory game for completion of [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).

## Project Description

Welcome to the interactive card matching game where you are supposed to flip cards, memorize their position and match two identical ones. You win once you've successfully matched all 8 pairs.

## How to Play

The game board consists of sixteen tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid. The deck consists of eight different pairs of cards, each with a specific symbol on a side. The challenge starts automatically upon page load. Click on the cards to reveal them. The goal is to reveal cards two at a time to match the pairs. The game ends when all pairs are revealed and correctly paired. You can also restart the game at any stage by clicking the restart button.
Try to win the game with the least moves possible and you will be awarded with more stars. Keep improving your memory.
